## Requirements
Python 3

## Usecases
You can use this in group chats where there are Armenians from abroad and who ususally do not read the Armenian alphabet fluently, but know Armenian. If your chatting platfrom of choice is Telegram, then you can use my bot https://t.me/wakamastersbot which has the latinistaion function built into it, but note that I do not always host it yet, so I recommend hosting it yourself if you intend to use it.
