# latinisation
After inputed a string of Armenian letters this program will convert the characters of that string to their equivalent latin characters. Copyright 2023 EarthMapsPictures Inc.

## Requirements
Python 3

## Usecases
You can use this in group chats where there are Armenians from abroad and who ususally do not read the Armenian alphabet fluently, but know Armenian. If your chatting platfrom of choice is Telegram, then you can use my bot https://t.me/wakamastersbot which has the latinistaion function built into it, but note that I do not always host it yet, so I recommend hosting it yourself if you intend to use it.

## How to use

Firstly open a terminal or command promt depending on the operating system you are using. 

Navigate to the folder the `latinisation.py` file is located. 

Use the `python3 latinistation.py` command to start running the Python version of the program.

Then simply type or copy the string of Armenian letters into the prompt and hit enter. You will then see the converted string appear.
